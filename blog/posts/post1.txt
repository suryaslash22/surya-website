So you've found your way to my blog, welcome! Lately I've been wanting to express myself on an online platform, and 
								if I can hone my web design skills at the same time, I thought, why not? (the correct answer is that I'm taking
								18 credits this semester) But yes, here I am. <br><br>
								
								And just in case a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_(newspaper)">Portuguese weekly newspaper</a> attacks me with 
								claims of unoriginality, here are a bunch of reasons why I named the blog SOL:
								<ul>
								<li>the word means <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sol">"the Sun"</a> in Latin, and hence a bunch of languages 
								(that I'm currently trying to learn);</li>
								<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya">Surya</a> means Sun in Sanskrit, hence another bunch of languages;</li>
								<li>it could be an abbreviation for 'Surya Online' (corny, I know);</li>
								<li>most importantly, it is also the word for 'word' in my mother tongue, Tamil.</li>
								</ul>
								So yes, multiple layers.<br><br>
								
								I'm probably going to use this blog as an outlet to rant about stuff. So please don't expect any topical posts, it's all
								going to be an assorted mix of what's on my mind on a post-worthy day.
								<br><br>
								
								My mind is my forbidden kingdom, but tourists like you are welcome -- limited entry only, though. That explains the picture. Also 
								not knowing what sort of picture to put up contributed to that chubby 13-year-old popping up again. But yes, stay tuned, 
								I'll try to stay active here.<br><br>
								
								Cheers!
